      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:19.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:
exactly">My philosophy on teaching is relatively simple: an instructor can hope 
      for excellence on the part of the students, but can only demand effort. My 
      primary goal in teaching is to motivate my students to be active learners 
      in mathematics. In addition to teaching my students mathematics, I <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>also 
      discuss emphatically how to study, how to read the text, and how to apply 
      mathematics skill to their other classes or even real life. Every student 
      in my class is there for a purpose. For those students who are engaged or 
      gifted in mathematics, I endeavor to further inspire them further and to 
      give them more ideas of the broader context of each lesson. For those 
      students whose true interests lie elsewhere or who struggle with the 
      material, I focus on drawing connections between the syllabus and their 
      chosen fields, and giving them the knowledge they need to succeed in 
      learning. Once my students want to study mathematics and once my students 
      know that they can do very well in mathematics, they learn more than I 
      teach because they can teach themselves.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:19.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:
exactly">To achieve the goal of my students¡¯ becoming ¡°active learners¡±, 
      when in front of any class, I urge students to interact with me concerning 
      the material I am presenting, but I usually like participation to be 
      voluntary. To achieve this, I build a personal relationship with each of 
      my students. I have been applauded by students for being an approachable 
      and accessible instructor. My office hours are often overflowing, leading 
      to an impromptu discussion section in the hallway. I bring a lot of energy 
      and excitement to the classroom, striving to keep my students learning, 
      interested and motivated. For example, in fall semester 2004 I taught 
      Business Calculus in our Freshman Academic program. This program allows 
      for my students to have lunch with me. This makes them feel comfortable in 
      class, and they do not hesitate to ask questions or make suggestions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:19.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:
exactly">A main purpose of my teaching is to convince students that they can 
      solve many problems by using their own skills. To achieve this, I usually 
      lead students to find new methods or new theorems instead of just stating 
      the methods or theorems. Here, for example, is how I introduced 
      integration by substitution in my Calculus class. ¡°The Chain Rule tells 
      that the derivative of sin x<sup>2</sup> is 2<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">x 
      </i>cos <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">x</i><sup>2</sup>. Now let¡¯s work backwards. What if we want the 
      integral of 2<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">x </i>cos <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">x</i><sup>2</sup>? 
      But how can we easily know the antiderivative is sin <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">x</i><sup>2</sup>?¡± 
      After students thought it through and eventually supplied the common 
      method: simplification, they responded by stating the essence of 
      integration by substitution, which we then formalized. Teaching in this 
      manner implicitly sends the message that students can use their own skills 
      to solve problems, even if they never encountered these problems before. 
      Whether in research or in elementary mathematics, one learns more from a 
      good example than from vague generalities.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:19.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:
exactly">Teaching is one of the vital roles of a faculty member. <span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">I 
      am excited about math and truly love <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>teaching 
      the subject. I want the quality of my teaching to be valued greatly by my 
      students and my employer. </span><st1:place w:st="on">

      often gives graduate students a chance to teach a variety of classes. With 
      full responsibility I taught Multivariable Calculus (Spring 2004 and Fall 
      2005), Business Calculus (Fall 2004). I also taught a lab and helped with 
      grading in First Semester Calculus, Second Semester Calculus, and Real 
      Analysis (graduate class).</p>

      students and have worked hard to polish my style and methods over the last 
      several years. My hard work and persistence was recognized in the 
      Department of Mathematics when I received the Best Teaching Assistant
